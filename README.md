# FinancialChatbot

The provided code implements a personal financial management chatbot powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 language model. The chatbot offers a conversational interface for users to inquire about their finances, gain insights from transaction history, and receive personalized financial advice. It analyzes transaction data, calculates total expenses, and generates natural and coherent responses. The code includes an example dataset and showcases the chatbot's ability to provide human-like financial assistance.
The code starts by installing the required OpenAI library and initializing the API key for authentication.
It defines a function called generate_response that takes a prompt as input and uses the OpenAI Completion API to generate a text response based on the prompt.
Another function called calculate_total_expenses is defined to process and analyze a given dataset. It calculates the total expenses by summing up the amounts of transactions that are not categorized as "income."
The code includes a dataset containing transaction information such as date, amount, category, and description.
A user query is provided as a prompt to the generate_response function, which generates a response from the language model based on the query.
The calculate_total_expenses function is called with the dataset as input to calculate the total expenses.
The generated response and the calculated total expenses are printed to the console, providing the user with the chatbot's response and the financial information.
